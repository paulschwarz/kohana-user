# Kohana User

Requires:
- Kohana 3.3
- PHP >= 5.4
- Modules
  - Arden-PHP - this separates out the persistence implementation from the business logic. A Kohana Database based
  implementation is provided in this module, however you are free to override this to provide any persistence you wish.
  - Kohana Database - if you use the bundles repositories (see above).
  - Kohana Oauth - if you want to use authentication providers.
  - Kostache - show me a better template engine?

A good starting point for a Kohana application with user functionality as well as common scaffolding for building an application.
